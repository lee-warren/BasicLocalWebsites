# BasicLocalWebsites

Just some simple games and a to do list that I have created.

All files are just HTML with in-document CSS and Javascript. ...Nothing fancy or all that interesting.

I didn't really focus much on the style of these, beyond some basic colouring, and most of this was created before I had any experince at all in Angular and some nicer web design.

To Do List:
  - This is the only file I have actually updated since I started working at Droppoint. 
  - I didn't change anything major about how the document was structured so it definetely is still quite basic. I have added categories to the ToDo List Items because I started working on another project and wanted to start using this to help jot down some ideas. It was too much of a big mess without categories. 
  - I still have a few thoughts to do with updating this but I don't know if I'll go back to it much or just move on to some other new things. Wouldn't mind implementing some more to do with Priorities or Due Dates.

Games:
  - Memory Match
  - Minesweepeer
  - 4-In-A-Row
